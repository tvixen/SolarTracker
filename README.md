# SolarTracker
This project was made because I only had a limited space for my sunpanels. So I created a suntracker, to track to sun the whole day.

This project is finished and needs to be updated with schematics and PCB's.
16/6-2022 Added Bluetooth to the project instead of nRF2401L. So its possible to use a mobile for manual control and readings.
